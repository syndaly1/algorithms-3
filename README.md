## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to optimize a cityâ€™s transportation network using two classical **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms â€” **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s**.  
The MST ensures that all city districts (vertices) are connected with the **minimum total construction cost** while maintaining full reachability.

Both algorithms were implemented, executed on multiple datasets, and analyzed based on:

* **Execution time (ms)**
* **Operation count**
* **Total MST cost**
* **Graph size and density**

## **Input Dataset**

The input data was generated and stored in **`ass_3_input.json`**, containing **30 weighted undirected graphs** of various sizes and densities.  
Graphs were divided into four categories based on vertex count and density to evaluate scalability and performance.

| Category   | Vertex Range            | Graphs | Purpose                               |
|------------|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| **Small**  | up to 30 vertices       | 5      | Debugging and correctness validation  |
| **Medium** | up to 300 vertices      | 10     | Moderate performance evaluation       |
| **Large**  | up to 1000 vertices     | 10     | Efficiency and scaling observation    |
| **Extra**  | more than 1000 vertices | 5      | High-load stress and scalability test |

Each dataset represents a **city road network** where:
- **Vertices** = city districts
- **Edges** = potential roads
- **Weights** = road construction costs

Connectivity was ensured by first constructing a spanning structure, guaranteeing that each vertex can reach any other.

**Files**
- `src/main/resources/ass_3_input.json` â€” complete dataset
- `src/main/resources/ass_3_output.json` â€” MST results per graph
- `summary.csv` â€” summarized data for analysis and charts

## **Algorithmic Approaches**

Both algorithms construct a **Minimum Spanning Tree**, but differ in logic and data structures.

| Algorithm               | Strategy                                                                     | Data Structure            | Time Complexity |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Primâ€™s Algorithm**    | Expands the MST by repeatedly adding the smallest edge from the growing tree | Priority Queue (Min-Heap) | **O(E log V)**  |
| **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm** | Builds the MST by sorting all edges and joining non-cyclic ones              | Disjoint Set (Union-Find) | **O(E log E)**  |

*Primâ€™s approach is vertex-driven (local), while Kruskalâ€™s is edge-driven (global).*  
Both guarantee identical MST cost, though runtime efficiency varies with graph density.

## **Experimental Results**

Execution was automated via **`cli/BenchmarkRunner`**, which:
1. Executes both algorithms for all 30 datasets.
2. Measures **execution time**, **operation count**, and **MST total cost**.
3. Outputs results to JSON and CSV formats.

| Sparse graphs | Kruskal faster | Confirmed | 
| MST cost equality | Expected | Verified | 

**Conclusion:**  
The results confirm that theory aligns with experimental behavior.  
**Primâ€™s algorithm** performs better on dense networks, while **Kruskalâ€™s** is more efficient for sparse graphs.  
Both maintain the same MST cost and scaling patterns as predicted.

## **Connectivity Validation**

All generated graphs were verified to be **connected** to ensure a valid MST exists for each case.  
This was achieved programmatically by constructing an initial spanning structure before adding random edges.  
JUnit tests also confirmed that every MST contains exactly **V âˆ’ 1 edges**, is **acyclic**, and has a single connected component â€” guaranteeing correctness.

## **Conclusions**

1. Both algorithms successfully built MSTs with identical total costs for all datasets.
2. **Primâ€™s algorithm** is preferred for **dense city-like networks**.
3. **Kruskalâ€™s algorithm** performs more efficiently for **sparse or rural networks**.
4. Experimental results confirmed **O(E log V)** and **O(E log E)** complexities in practice.
5. All generated MSTs were connected, acyclic, and valid (|E| = V âˆ’ 1).
